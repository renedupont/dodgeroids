**Introduction:**
This Privacy Policy outlines the information collection, usage, and storage practices for Dodgeroids, a mobile application available on the Google Play Store. By installing and using this game, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

**Information Collection:**
Dodgeroids does not collect any personal information from users. The game solely focuses on providing an entertainment experience without requesting or storing any data that can be used to personally identify individuals.

**Score and Settings Storage:**
Dodgeroids stores two types of data locally on the user's device:
- The score achieved by the user within the game.
- The user's preference for sound settings (on or off).

Both pieces of information are stored locally to enhance the gaming experience. The score allows users to track and compare their progress, while the sound setting preference ensures that the game adjusts audio based on individual user preferences.

**Permissions:**
Dodgeroids requires certain permissions to function properly on your device. These permissions are related solely to the core functionality of the game, such as accessing storage to save the local score and sound settings. The game does not misuse permissions or access any information beyond what is essential for its intended purpose.

**Third-Party Services:**
Dodgeroids does not integrate with any third-party services or APIs that would involve the sharing of user data. The game operates independently on the user's device, ensuring that no external entities have access to personal information.

**Children's Privacy:**
Dodgeroids is not designed for or directed towards children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from individuals under the age of 13. If you believe that we may have unintentionally collected information from a child under 13, please contact us, and we will promptly address the matter.

**Changes to Privacy Policy:**
We reserve the right to update and modify this Privacy Policy as needed. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of this policy. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically to stay informed about our information practices.
