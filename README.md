# Dodgeroids

Dodgeroids is an Android game in which you're flying a spaceship that has to dodge incoming 
asteroids to not get destroyed.

Please visit [Dodgeroids](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.games.dodgeroids) at the 
Google Play Store for information about the game!

**Note:** This game is the result of a hobby project a [friend](https://github.com/Creckle) of mine 
and I did in 2013 to learn a bit of Android and OpenGL ES coding. I recently upgraded the Android 
part to a more recent version and refactored some of the code. It is certainly still no masterpiece 
:wink:. There are currently no plans to develop that game any further.
